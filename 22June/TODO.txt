- Check homework1 folder for homework - 10 mins
+ Question: 
+ + why IMG_INit & flag ?
+ + What needed to be render a square to screen
+ + ...

- Improve the existing project by split as much functions as possible: 30 mins
+ IMG_Quit()
+ HandleEvent(SDL_Event e)
+ LoadFromFile ( image )
+ Vector2D struct ?

- What happen if we want to have more than 1 image on screen ? how many function to call draw, init and everything
we have to add ? 
+ The idea here is every time we need a texture, just need : Texture* texture = new Texture(path_to_file);
+ Create class Texture2D by draw an UML related ( 15 mins )
===============
   Texture2D 
===============
// data
- width
- height
- sdl_renderer ( when call draw )
- sdl_texture ( chac chan roi )
===============
// function
+ Constructor()
+ Destructor()
+ FreeMemory()
+ Get & Set
+ bool LoadFromFile(string file path) // return if load success or not
+ Render(param ?)
===============

- Now how can we use the Texture2D class ?
+ Remove all the SDL_Texture usage in Source
+ Replace by the texture

==============================================================================
- How about now if I need another screen for About ?
+ We need a SceneManager
+ Idea is when we want to load another scene by pressing key, just need to call ChangeScene
+ Q: preload or in-time load ?
=====> What is the common for all scene
=============
SCENE
=============
- Texture ?
- SDL_Render
=============
+ Constructor
+ Destructor

+ virtual void Render ( pure Virtual ? )
+ virtual void Update ( pure Virtual ? )
=============

======> Now we have level 1 and intro ...
What supposed to be in level 1 ? and in intro title ? ( each have 2 diffent background image ) 30 min

=============
SCENE-LEVEL1
=============
- Texture2D
- SetLevel ( consider each level only have Background )
=============
+ Constructor
+ Destructor
+ Render
+ Update
=============

===========> Change scene when press key => Learn how to control memory
=============================================================================
We have background now, now we need a player runing on it

- Create Character Class ( 30 min )

=============
CHARACTER
=============
- Texture2D
- SetLevel ( consider each level only have Background )
=============
+ Constructor
+ Destructor
+ Render
+ Update
=============
